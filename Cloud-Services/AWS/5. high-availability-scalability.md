## Application Load balancer (ALB)

- Routing tables based on different target groups,
  - Path in Url (example.com/`users`, example.com/`posts`)
  - Hostname in URL
  - Query string, Headers
- Great fit for micro services and container based applications
- Port mapping features to redirect to dynamic port to ECS.
- We would need multiple classic load balancer (comparing to Application Load balancer)
